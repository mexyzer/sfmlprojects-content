Title: Pseuthe

Brief: Pseuthe (pronounced 'soothe') is an abstract audio / visual experience, with casual game play elements.

----

Description: Take on the role of a proterozoic plankton with the sole aim of survival - absorb and consume the healthy microbes whilst avoiding those detrimental to your health. If you don't eat you will slowly starve to death, and colliding with obstacles will also reduce your health. The game ends once you fade out of existence. There are four kinds of microbes to look out for. The most common are either green or red. Green microbes give you health when eaten, red will take some away. Red microbes are sick and dying, and will fade away slowly. There are also blue 'viral' microbes which are less common, but will give you a significant health boost. Very rarely you will also see something akin to a jelly fish. These fade rapidly, but eating one gives you full health, so eat it quick! Microbes don't like to group. Striking red plankton to help them die sooner will promote the arrival of new microbes - but don't accidentally swallow anything nasty...
